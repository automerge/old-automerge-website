In this tutorial, you'll build on the concepts from the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart/intro) to create a more sophisticated document management system. You'll learn how to:

- Create and manage a persistent user account document
- Store and retrieve document references
- Build a document listing interface
- Implement document switching
- Handle document sharing and collaboration

## Setup

<Admonition type="info">

This tutorial builds on the code from the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart/intro). Make sure you've completed that first!

</Admonition>

To get started:

1. Create a new branch from your quickstart project
2. Install any additional dependencies
3. Start the development server

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
$ git checkout -b account-based
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
$ git checkout -b account-based
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
$ git checkout -b account-based
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What We'll Build

You might have noticed that if you lose the URL of a document in the quickstart, it's gone forever. This is fine for testing and demos, but obviously no good for a real application.

Automerge is built around the document as a building block for your application, and we use AutomergeUrl links to connect those documents together. We've already created one kind of document, a task list, and now we're going to build on that foundation by collecting your task lists into something like a folder to keep them organized.

This is going to give us a chance to see a few patterns in action: linking between documents with URLs, working with multiple documents at once, and using a single document as the "entry point" for your application.

You can think of the "entry point" as being akin to a user's account. By synchronizing that document between their devices, a user can get access to their documents from multiple browsers or devices, but be careful: until we implement some kind of security on the sync server, a user's privacy relies on their not sharing that "root" document ID with anyone else.

Here's the plan. We'll are going to:

1. Create a new "listing" document which links to all the documents the user has opened.
2. Register documents we open or create in that listing (if we don't have them already.)
3. Store that document's ID in localStorage in a well-known key to check during startup.
4. Create a simple UI for copying the account document between browsers, creating rudimentary "accounts".

If this feels different to you from how a traditional database works, that's normal. With Automerge, building an application will feel more like linking together a web of documents than querying a database.
