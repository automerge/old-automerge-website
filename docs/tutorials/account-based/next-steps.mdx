import { jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";

## Congratulations!

QUICKSTART:
clone this and you're off

- clonable empty projects for
  react
  (later)
  vanilla
  svelte
  (someday)
  solid
  vue
  angular
  etc

TUTORIAL:
without-automerge todo through account-based sharing
ideally eventually we have tutorials (or at least example repos) for each framework

PVHNOTE:
next steps
switch to hub&spoke for efficiency with serviceworker <-- broadcastchannel is inefficient & so is many network cxns / storage
load images from serviceworker

try one of the editor integrations: codemirror/prosemirror/tldraw

run your own sync server (with some basic oauth) [SOMEDAY]

advanced tutorial line:
working with versioning: time-travel / conflicts / diffs / branches

You've built a sophisticated document management system with Automerge that supports:

- Account persistence
- Document listing and switching
- Real-time collaboration
- Document sharing
- Offline support

## Production Considerations

Before deploying to production, consider these improvements:

1. **Security**

   - Run your own sync server
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add document access control
   - Encrypt sensitive data

2. **User Experience**

   - Add document titles and descriptions
   - Implement document search
   - Add document categories or tags
   - Show document activity status
   - Add user presence indicators

3. **Performance**

   - Implement document pagination
   - Add document archiving
   - Optimize sync frequency
   - Add loading states and error handling

4. **Features**
   - Add document comments
   - Implement document versioning
   - Add document export/import
   - Add user profiles and avatars
