Automerge is a suite of tools for building [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first) web applications with real-time synchronization that works on and offline.

In this tutorial, you'll build a local-first multiplayer app with TypeScript, React, [Vite](https://vite.dev), and Automerge. You'll discover how to:

- Represent data as Automerge [Documents](/docs/concepts/#documents)
- [Change](/docs/documents/conflicts/) documents' data and [merge](/docs/under-the-hood/merge_rules/) changes from different peers
- Store & synchronize a set of documents in an Automerge [Repository](/docs/concepts/#repositories)
- Build a multiplayer realtime web app with the Automerge [React client](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/tree/main/packages/automerge-repo-react-hooks)

## Setup

<Admonition type="info">

All the code here can be found at the [automerge-repo-quickstart](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-quickstart) repo.

</Admonition>

To get started:

- clone the tutorial project from [automerge-repo-quickstart](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-quickstart)
- switch to the `without-automerge` branch
- in the `automerge-repo-quickstart` directory, install the project dependencies
- start the local Vite development server

Visit [localhost:5173/automerge-repo-quickstart/](http://localhost:5173/automerge-repo-quickstart/) to see the app in its "starter" state, as a basic React app not yet using Automerge: the task list can be edited, but changes are not synced between users, and all local changes are lost when the page is closed or reloaded.

Let's fix all that with Automerge!

In the exercises that follow, you'll modify the source code to:

1. Configure a Repository to store & sync document changes locally
1. Create/retrieve a task list Document by its Document URL
1. Use the Automerge React client to update the Doc's data on user input
1. Update the Repo to also sync changes over the network (when available)
